# dqedit
The dqedit component is the editor for the mapping necessary to translate domain questions / RQA definitions to technical RQA configurations. The editor can be used by domain and technical experts during DDD-based workshops, e.g., for event storming or DST, where the domain elements are identified and defined.

A more detailed description of this component's architecture is provided in the [arc42 document](https://dqualizer.github.io/dqualizer).
